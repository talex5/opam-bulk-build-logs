         description: Bindings for Linux libdevicemapper

Linux's device mapper allows one to create virtual block devices
on top of existing devices. The virtual devices may be remapped,
mirrored, thin-provisioned etc. Device mapper is used to support
logical volume management systems such as LVM.
