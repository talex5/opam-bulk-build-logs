         description: Library to create, manipulate and reason about PROMELA data structures.

The PROMELA OCaml library provides types to create, manipulate and to reason 
about PROMELA programs. The OCaml data structures can finally be converted to 
their textual representation with a pretty-printer to be used with the SPIN 
model checker.
