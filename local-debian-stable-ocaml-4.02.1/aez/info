         description: Alt-Ergo Zero is an OCaml library for an SMT solver.

This SMT solver is derived from Alt-Ergo. It uses an efficient SAT solver and
supports the following quantifier free theories:
    - Equality and uninterpreted functions
    - Arithmetic (linear, non-linear, integer, real)
    - Enumerated data-types

This API makes heavy use of hash consing, in particular hash-consed strings.
