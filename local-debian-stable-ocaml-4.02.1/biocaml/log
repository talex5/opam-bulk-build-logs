The following dependencies couldn't be met:
  - biocaml -> core <= 109.47.00 -> custom_printf = 109.27.00
Your request can't be satisfied:
  - core<=109.17.00 is not available because it requires OCaml >= 4.00.1 & < 4.01.0.
  - custom_printf.109.27.00 is not available because it requires OCaml < 4.02.0.

No solution found, exiting
'opam install biocaml' failed.
