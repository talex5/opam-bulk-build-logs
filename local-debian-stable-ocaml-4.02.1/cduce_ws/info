         description: Library fo Web Services creation
CDuce_WS is library for Web Services creation. It can be used alone
for the creation of clients programs, and with OcCDuce for servers.

Basically, CDuce_WS is a CDuce representation of the SOAP protocol
structures (SOAP Envelope, SOAP Encoding, etc.) with some helper
functions to ease the programmation of Web Services. Additionally, a
WSDL structure is also provided, as well as some functions (adapted
from OCSoap) to extract useful information from a WSDL file.
