         description: A tool to facilitate the installation of OCaml annotation files (.cmt, .cmti, .spot, .spit). 
Many existing OCaml libraries, applications and the compiler itself do
not produce or install the annotation files (.annot, .cmt, .cmti,
.spot, .spit) which are essential for sub-expression type queries
(caml-types.el), definition seaches and code refactoring (TypeRex and
OCamlSpotter). If you want to use development tools, you have to:

* Rebuild all the software from the source, adding -annot/-bin-annot
  option to compiler flags in build scripts
  i.e. Makefile/OCamlBuild/OMakefile.

* Install those annotation files together with the library objects and
  signatures. (Require modification of the build scripts)

for all the programs.

SpotInstall provides a post-installation workaround: a small tool to install annotation files to the library destination directory. (You no longer need to add annotation file installation to the build scripts.)
