About the OCAML core installation:
    Standard library:      /usr/lib/ocaml
    Binaries:              /usr/bin
    Manual pages:          /usr/local/man
    Multi-threading type:  posix
The directory of site-specific packages will be
    site-lib:              /home/opam/.opam/system/lib
The configuration file is written to:
    findlib config file:   /home/opam/.opam/system/lib/findlib.conf
Software will be installed:
    Libraries:             in <site-lib>/findlib
    Binaries:              /home/opam/.opam/system/bin
    Manual pages:          /home/opam/.opam/system/man
    topfind script:        omitted
Topfind ppxopt support:    yes
Toolbox:                   no
Link custom runtime:       yes
Need bytes compatibility:  no

Configuration has been written to Makefile.config

You can now do 'make all', and optionally 'make opt', to build ocamlfind.
