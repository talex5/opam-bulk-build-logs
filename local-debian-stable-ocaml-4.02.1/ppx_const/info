         description: Compile-time "if" statement for conditional inclusion of code.

This is a ppx extension which adds an `if#const` construct to OCaml. It behaves
like normal `if`, but the condition is evaluated at compile time and the AST
section not selected is excluded from the program completely. In conjunction
with ppx_getenv, this can be used for conditional compilation of code.
