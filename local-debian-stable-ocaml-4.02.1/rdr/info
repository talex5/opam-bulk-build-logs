         description: Rdr is a cross-platform binary analysis and reverse engineering tool, utilizing a unique symbol map for global analysis.

`rdr` is an OCaml tool/library for doing cross-platform analysis of binaries, by printing headers, locating entry points, showing import and export symbols, their binary offsets and size, etc.

It also features a symbol map which allows fast lookups for arbitrary symbols, and their associated data, on your system (the default search location are binaries in /usr/lib).

See the README at http://github.com/m4b/rdr for more details.

Features:

* 64-bit Linux and Mach-o binary analysis
* Searchable symbol-map of all the symbols on your system, including binary offset, size, and exporting library
* Print imports and exports of binaries
* Make pretty graphs, at the binary or symbol map level
