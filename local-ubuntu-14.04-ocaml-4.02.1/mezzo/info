         description: We present the design of Mezzo, a programming language in the ML tradition,
which places strong emphasis on the control of aliasing and access to mutable
memory. A balance between simplicity and expressiveness is achieved by
marrying a static discipline of permissions and a dynamic mechanism of
adoption and abandon.
