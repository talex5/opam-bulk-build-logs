         description: Retrieve data from an Apache logfile with a syntax derived from the SQL language.

What apalogretrieve makes possible here is to retrieve the fields by their name 
and use filters (WHERE-clause) as well as boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT). You 
also have a simple regular expression mechanism, like the like-operator from 
SQL.
