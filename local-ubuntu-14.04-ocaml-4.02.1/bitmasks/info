         description: BitMasks over int and int64 exposed as sets
Library for exposing bitmasks (typically as int or int64) in an
implementation compatible with OCaml's Set. The underlying data
representation is unaltered, allowing the value to be manipulated
either as a bitmask or as a set without conversion.
