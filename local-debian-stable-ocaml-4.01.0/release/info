         description: Release is a multi-process Lwt-enabled daemon framework for OCaml.

It provides facilities for type-safe inter-process communication and
privilege-dropping.

Its goal is to make it easy to write servers that are released from the calling
terminal and to release root privileges when those are not necessary.
