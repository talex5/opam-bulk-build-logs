- About the OCAML core installation:
-     Standard library:      /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/lib/ocaml
-     Binaries:              /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/bin
-     Manual pages:          /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/man
-     Multi-threading type:  posix
- The directory of site-specific packages will be
-     site-lib:              /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/lib
- The configuration file is written to:
-     findlib config file:   /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/lib/findlib.conf
- Software will be installed:
-     Libraries:             in <site-lib>/findlib
-     Binaries:              /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/bin
-     Manual pages:          /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/man
-     topfind script:        /home/opam/.opam/4.01.0/lib/ocaml
- Topfind ppxopt support:    no
- Toolbox:                   no
- Link custom runtime:       yes
- Need bytes compatibility:  yes
- 
- Configuration has been written to Makefile.config
- 
- You can now do 'make all', and optionally 'make opt', to build ocamlfind.
