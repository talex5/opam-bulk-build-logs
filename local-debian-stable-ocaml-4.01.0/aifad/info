         description: Machine learning library and application written in OCaml which generalizes decision tree learning to algebraic data types
AIFAD stands for Automated Induction of Functions over Algebraic Data
Types and is an application written in OCaml that improves decision
tree learning by supporting significantly more complex kinds of
data. This allows users to more conveniently describe the data they
want to learn functions on and can improve the accuracy and complexity
of resulting models.
