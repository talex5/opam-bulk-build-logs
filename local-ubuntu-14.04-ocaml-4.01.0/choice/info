         description: Monadic combinators for enumerating alternatives.

The library provides combinators to branch and test through
alternatives, with fair strategies and restricted pruning of the search
tree. It is written in a continuation-passing style, from the paper
at http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/logicprog/LogicT-icfp2005.pdf .
