         description: A linear algebra library with static size checking for matrix operations
Sized Linear Algebra Package (SLAP) is a wrapper of Lacaml, a binding of two
widely used linear algebra libraries BLAS and LAPACK for FORTRAN. This
guarantees statically (i.e, at compile time) consistency (with respect to
dimensions) of most high-level matrix (and vector) operations. For example,
addition of two- and three-dimensional vectors causes type error at compile
time, and dynamic errors like exceptions do not happen.
