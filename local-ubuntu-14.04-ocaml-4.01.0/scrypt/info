         description: C bindings and a high level interface to the official scrypt distribution.

scrypt is key derivation function designed to be far more secure against hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such as PBKDF2 or bcrypt.

scrypt was originally developed by Colin Percival for use in the Tarnsnap online backup system.
