         description: Automated theorem prover for first order classical logic (with equality), based on the tableau method
Zenon is an automatic theorem prover written in OCaml. Zenon handles
first-order logic with equality. Its most important feature is that it
outputs the proofs of the theorems, in Coq-checkable form.
