         description: Flow Caml is an extension of OCaml with a type system tracing information flow.

Its purpose is basically to allow to write ``real'' programs and to
automatically check that they obey some confidentiality or integrity
policy.  In Flow Caml, standard ML types are annotated with security
levels chosen in a suitable lattice.  Each annotation gives an
approximation of the information that the described expression may
convey.  Because it has full type inference, the system verifies,
without requiring source code annotations, that every information flow
caused by the analyzed program is legal with regard to the security
policy specified by the programmer.
